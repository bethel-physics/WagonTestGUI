----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


	Scene: Splash Scene

	Date Updated: 6/16/23


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


	The Splash Scene is displayed when the graphical user interface (GUI) is first
	ran. The information provides credit to the students largely responsible
	for the creation of this interface. The three students listed, along with
	their home institutions are as follows:
	
		- Bryan Crossman (University of Minnesota)
		- Andrew Kirzeder (Bethel University)
		- Garrett Schindler (Bethel University)

	This scene should only be displayed for a short period of time before
	moving on to the next scene. The next scene should be the Login Scene.
	No buttons are required to be pressed on this screen.
