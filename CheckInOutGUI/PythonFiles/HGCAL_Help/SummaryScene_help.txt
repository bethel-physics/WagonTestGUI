	Scene: Test Summary Scene

	Date Updated: 6/16/23


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The Test Summary Scene is responsible for showing all of the results that
	the GUI has gathered. The information is stored in a DataHolder object 
	while it is gathered throughout the process. The Test Summary Scene 
	displays the attributes of the DataHolder object to the user to ensure
	that all of the information has been stored correctly.

	The top of the screen should display the tester's name as well as the 
	serial identification number for the board that is being tested. 

	Each of the tests that are listed for the board are displayed below. The 
	GUI keeps track of whether or not certain tests have been completed.
	The information displayed for each test is the "Test Name", "Test Status",
	and "Pass/Fail". These display which type of test, whether or not it has
	been run, and whether or not it has passed the test. Notice that a pass 
	is signified by a green checkmark and a fail is signified by a red x.

	To the right of the displayed information are two buttons; "More Info" and
	"Retest". The "More Info" button will open a popup window with JSON 
	information that the tester has sent back to the GUI. If you want to know
	more about the specific test results, press this button. The "Retest" 
	button will send you back to the Test Scene for the designated test. 
	Upon finishing this retest, the GUI will send you back to the Test 
	Summary Scene. 

	Upon reaching the Test Summary Scene, the DataHolder object is uploaded to
	the database. When you complete a retest for a specified board, the 
	information stored in the database for that board will be updated.
