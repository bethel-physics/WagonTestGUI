	Scene: Test In Progress Scene

	Date Updated: 6/16/23


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The Test In Progress Scene is displayed while you are running a test on
	the testing machine. When working correctly, the test machine will send 
	dialog back to the GUI describing the current testing process. This type
	of logging is run through a connection queue.

	If the GUI does not receive an initial response from the test stand after
	10 seconds, the GUI will throw a timeout error (popup window). This error
	message will say "TestInProgressScene: Process timed out after 10 seconds".
	Upon pressing the "OK" button, you will be brought back to the Login Scene
	where you can restart the process.

	If the previous error persists for more than one occurance, you will need
	to check the status of the REPServer that has been launched on the test
	stand. If the server is not running on the test stand, the GUI will never
	be able to receive a response, therefore always throwing this error.

	The GUI cannot be closed while the Test In Progress Scene is on the 
	screen. If you gry to quit the application by clicking the "X" in the top,
	right corner, a popup window will show saying that "You cannot quit the
	application during a test!". This is to prevent corruption of test data.

	There is a "Stop" button in the middle of the application that tries to 
	stop the test. If able to successfully stop the test, the GUI will go to 
	the next available test. If there are no more available tests, then 
	the next scene will be the Test Summary Scene. 

	If the test has been completed successfully and the results have been 
	received by the GUI, then the GUI will automatically go to the next scene.
	The next scene will either be the next Test Scene (if available) or will
	be the Test Summary Scene (if the last test has been finished).
