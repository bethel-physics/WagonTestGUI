	Scene: Scan Scene

	Date Updated: 6/16/23


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The Scan Scene is displayed after the Login Scene. It also marks the
	beginning of testing a new board (either wagon or engine). This scene
	is responsible for gathering the serial identification number, which 
	is often displayed directly on the board via a QR code.

	The submit button (which leads to the next scene) is grayed out until
	the serial id box has been filled. This box can be filled in two 
	different ways. 

	The most efficient way to fill the text field is to
	scan the box using an EventListener scanner attached to the computer.
	The scanner should be attached to the computer that is actively 
	running the GUI. After successfully scanning a QR code, the scanner
	should beep, and the text should be filled into the field. Notice that 
	the text field will become grayed out after information has been 
	scanned into it. After scanning, if you would like to change the 
	serial number entered, you will need to press the "Rescan" button to 
	reactivate the scanner.

	The scanner runs on a completely separate process from the GUI, which
	can cause issues with sections of code not completing correctly. In
	some cases, the scanner may be stuck in a constant state of searching 
	for QR code information. If this is the case, be sure to press the
	button that says "Report Bug" and report the issue. 

	If the physical scanner is not available, you are also able to manually
	enter the serial identification into the box. Note that this will not
	require pressing the "Rescan" button nor will it gray out the text field.
	
	After the entry of the serial ID matches the board that you would like
	to test, select the "Submit" button in order to move onto the next scene.
	Before moving to the next scene, the GUI will request more information
	about your board by sending the serial ID to the database. If the serial
	ID is recognized as invalid, errors may occur within the GUI.


	Note: If the serial ID is recognized and the board has been tested
		  before, the GUI may skip some of the previously passed tests
		  in order to save time.
