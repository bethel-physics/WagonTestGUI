	Scene: Login Scene

	Date Updated: 6/16/23


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


	The Login Scene is displayed directly after the Splash Scene as well as
	via the "logout" buttons on many scenes. The purpose of this scene is to
	have the user log into the system using the credentials stored on the 
	web database. When this scene is shown, there is a call to the web 
	database to grab the login options.

	Users must select an option from the list of users provided in the drop-
	down box. After selecting the desired user's name, the submit button will
	bring you to the next scene, which is the Scan Scene.

	If there is not an option for a specific user, you can select 
	the "Add User" button to bring you to the Add User Scene.
